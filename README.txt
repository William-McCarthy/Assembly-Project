						Tackle Alley
Welcome to tackle alley
To play, move the red football player with "wasd", w will move him to the top of the screen,
s to the bottom of the screen, a to the right of the screen, and d to the left of the screen

To pause, press p, and to resume press r. 

The defense are the purple players, watch out some move at a non constant speed. Don't get too
close to them or you will be tackled, and lose the game. The defense will dive, so keep your space.

to win, make it to the end zone. Also, dont forget the power ups, which are placed randomly around 
the screen. The onion stinks up your breathe, so no one will tackle you, blue increases your speed,
and red slows you down. 

The game starts when the whistle blows, so good luck, and score some touchdowns.
